  //--- Submission pipeline state -------------------------------------------//
  //
  // Threading model: the queue has three execution contexts.

  //     AQL slot reservation, packet fill, notification ring push, frontier
  //     snapshot push, queue frontier mutation, last_signal update, kernarg
  //     allocation. Multiple threads may submit to the same queue; the mutex
  //     serializes them. Independent queues do not synchronize.
  //
  //   Completion drain (single serialized consumer):
  //     Waits on the notification ring epoch signal with
  //     hsa_amd_signal_wait_any from the queue-owned completion thread, or is
  //     entered by a direct host waiter after it independently observes a
  //     producer epoch. Drains completed entries, checks error_status, reclaims
  //     kernargs, and advances the queue frontier tracker. Reads the
  //     notification ring and the atomic error_status through one serialized
  //     runner. completion_drain_mutex protects runner ownership only and is
  //     never held while transitions, callbacks, or resource releases run.
  //     Both the queue-owned completion thread and waiter-assisted drains run
  //     post-drain continuations after the serialized claim. Never writes to
  //     submission-path fields except the final producer-serialized cursor
  //     commit.
  //
  //   Terminal failure (any thread that can prove the queue is initialized):
  //     Takes submission_mutex, installs the first error_status and closes
  //     submission admission in the same critical section, then signals
  //     completion.stop_signal after unlock. Reached from the queue's own HSA
  //     error callback, from the process-wide HSA system event callback, and
  //     from this driver's own wait paths. No caller may already hold
  //     submission_mutex; system-event delivery orders registry before
  //     submission.
  //
  // Wait-resolution fast-path contract:
  //   - Same-queue signal-before-wait is elided directly from the semaphore's
  //     last_signal cache when the cached producer axis matches queue->axis
  //     under this strategy's current all-BARRIER AQL policy.
  //   - Local cross-queue waits use one producer epoch barrier when the
  //     semaphore cache marks that producer frontier as exact and this queue's
  //     frontier does not already dominate that producer axis/epoch.
  //   - The full semaphore-frontier mutex/copy path is reserved for unresolved
  //     waits whose cached producer frontier is not exact (for example, true
  //     multi-producer fan-in) or for conservative fallback after
  //     cache/frontier overflow.
  //   - Wait-before-signal, remote/non-queue-domain axes, and queue teardown
  //     use software deferral.
  //
  // Signal-commit fast-path contract:
  //   - Each successful AQL submission advances this queue's epoch, merges this
  //     queue axis into queue->frontier, reserves one queue-private reclaim
  //     slot, pushes one notification-ring entry per user-visible signal
  //     semaphore, and records enough signal metadata for completion drain.
  //     Zero-signal submissions still consume one queue epoch and reclaim slot
  //     so kernel resources retire through the same mechanism.
